# ðŸŒ» Gardens

The ðŸŒ»Gardens Swarm manages the development of the Gardens Template and associated Aragon Apps and is doing the initial experiments into how Gardens should best be structured. Updates can be seen on [Token Engineering Commons](https://tecommons.medium.com/) medium page.

Gardens are a social, financial, and technical foundation for online communities to organize. This empowers people to coordinate around causes, social movements, or even memes. Gardens are designed to be operationally decentralized and autonomous from day one.

## Proposal Information

### Background, Overview and Proposal Rationale

We are building the first implementation of the Commons Stackâ€™s Commons Model, a DAO initially funded by a Trusted Seed (Hatch), later powered by an Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC), whose funds are managed with Conviction Voting (CV), and governed with Dandelion Voting (DV). See our previous successful funding request: [Bootstrapping the Gardens Swarm DAO](https://forum.1hive.org/t/bootstrapping-the-1hive-gardens-swarm-dao/1159)

### Proposal description

This proposal is to support the Gardens Swarm team to continue developing improvements and adaptations to 1hiveâ€™s marketplace app (hatch and augmented bonding curve), and the conviction voting frontend.

Because of the ~80% drop in the HNY price since the original proposal we need to request more HNY to finish our work in partnership with the TE Commons and the Commons Stack.

### Deliverables so far:

We have delivered a useable prototype for each of the 4 pieces of the DAO:

Hatch: We adapted Aragon Blackâ€™s fundraising app (Specifically presale.sol) and upgraded it to use Aragon connect. Hereâ€™s the second iteration: [hatch.tecommons.org](https://hatch.tecommons.org/)

ABC: We adapted Aragon Convert to use 1hive Marketplace (which converts tokens without batching). You can exchange TESTTEC Tokens via an Augmented Bonding Curve: [convert.tecommons.org](https://convert.tecommons.org/)

CV: We adapted 1hive Honeypot v1 to be used with two tokens, and adjusted the governance token price oracle to read from the bonding curve instead of honeyswap. You can vote with Conviction Voting Here: [gov.tecommons.org](https://gov.tecommons.org/#/)

DV: We ran a demo of 1hive Dandelion Voting with the TEC community here: TEC Test Dandelion Voting App

And most recently, we are tying all four of these prototypes together in a 2 part launch, the first part of this is the TEC Test HatchDAO launched here: [hatch.tecommons.org](https://hatch.tecommons.org/)

A lot of documentation and sensemaking around the various parameters has been happening in the Forum to reduce the reliance on technocracy to design cryptoeconomies: https://forum.tecommons.org/c/Token-talk-anything-about-the-TEC-token-such-as-issuance-and-hatches/9

Legal strategies have been solidified and can be duplicated for others. We have a 2 part launch where initially there is no bonding curve, the participants technically lose money, making it much easier, especially since we are able to use the Commons Stackâ€™s Swiss Association as a legal shield.

### Upcoming Deliverables:

The 1hive Gardens Swarm is one of several work streams building the first iteration of the future of Public Goods funding. Here is a general overview of the projectâ€™s roadmap:

Now: User testing has begun of the initial system

Jan 10th-ish: The ABC and CV aragon apps will be ready to be added into the Test Hatch DAO

Jan 20th-ish: The Hatch Smart Contracts will have full test coverage and be frozen for review

Jan28th-ish: Have the initial Models for the Hatch done so we can start proposing Parameters for the TEC Hatch DAO

Feb 1st-ish: The ABC and CV contracts will finish user testing and be frozen for review.

Feb 7th-ish: Do a second test, this time a full dress rehearsal with parameters chosen by a vote

March 10th-ish: Launch the TEC Hatch, this time a full dress rehearsal with parameters chosen by a vote

March 30th-ish: TEC votes for Commons Upgrade

April 30th-ish: Improvements based on TEC experience are finished being integrated and other communities are invited to use the template.

### Expected duration or delivery date:

There will be 1 more full Dress Rehearsal launch test and the final template will be ready for any community to play with in April, after the successful Hatch and Upgrade of the TE Commons, as the first Commons.

After this launch we expect to request funding for continued work on this template from the TE Commons itself.
